    Assignment 04 - Finishing a Todo List App

    Instructions:

    Important checklist:

    - Are users able to create and delete to do list items?
    - Have you set a favicon? (included - but it's a rocket)
    - Has a team member conducted a code review and left a GitHub Issue in your repo?
    - Have you conducted a code review and left a GitHub Issue on your team member's repo?

<!-- Create a form with a submit button. 
  Make a list that will display each item as they are added.
  The added elements must have buttons to mark them done and then delete them.
